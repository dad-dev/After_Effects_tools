## BeastKit
A broadcast television on-air versioning application. Somewhat Loosely designed around MVC (with some liberties taken here and there). This is totally bespoke code, but ideas within, such as the interface and queueing system, could easily be repurposed. In fact, one of the long term goals of this is to abstract it out to the point where it can be quickly made to fit almost any on-air design package, perhaps even by the user.

It's messy, needs lots of refactoring. Working on it.
