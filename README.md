Applications and utilities, automation scripts and expressions.

## BeastKit
A broadcast television on-air versioning application. Loosely designed around MVC, but written much too quickly to give the design a proper name. This is totally bespoke code, but could be adapted for other uses and there are long term goals of abstracting things out to make a more broadly applicable tool.  Due to the constraints of the workplace this repo will rarely track what's in production.
